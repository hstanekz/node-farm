# node-farm

## Introduction

Node Farm, a virtual mini farm where you can explore a curated selection of fresh and organic items!

## What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use Node.js to create an API and server for the first time.
I gained knowledge on setting up a Node.js project, creating routes and handling HTTP requests, parsing request bodies, and implementing CRUD operations.
